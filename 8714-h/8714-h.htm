    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The surviving dramas of Aeschylus are seven in number, though he is
      believed to have written nearly a hundred during his life of sixty-nine
      years, from 525 B.C. to 456 B.C. That he fought at Marathon in 490, and at
      Salamis in 480 B.C. is a strongly accredited tradition, rendered almost
      certain by the vivid references to both battles in his play of <i>The
      Persians</i>, which was produced in 472. But his earliest extant play was,
      probably, not <i>The Persians</i> but <i>The Suppliant Maidens</i>&mdash;a
      mythical drama, the fame of which has been largely eclipsed by the
      historic interest of <i>The Persians</i>, and is undoubtedly the least
      known and least regarded of the seven. Its topic&mdash;the flight of the
      daughters of Danaus from Egypt to Argos, in order to escape from a forced
      bridal with their first-cousins, the sons of Aegyptus&mdash;is legendary,
      and the lyric element predominates in the play as a whole. We must keep
      ourselves reminded that the ancient Athenian custom of presenting dramas
      in <i>Trilogies</i> &mdash;that is, in three consecutive plays dealing
      with different stages of one legend&mdash;was probably not uniform: it
      survives, for us, in one instance only, viz. the Orestean Trilogy,
      comprising the <i>Agamemnon</i>, the <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, and the <i>Eumenides</i>,
      or <i>Furies</i>. This Trilogy is the masterpiece of the Aeschylean Drama:
      the four remaining plays of the poet, which are translated in this volume,
      are all fragments of lost Trilogies&mdash;that is to say, the plays are
      complete as <i>poems</i>, but in regard to the poet's larger design they
      are fragments; they once had predecessors, or sequels, of which only a few
      words, or lines, or short paragraphs, survive. It is not certain, but
      seems probable, that the earliest of these single completed plays is <i>The
      Suppliant Maidens</i>, and on that supposition it has been placed first in
      the present volume. The maidens, accompanied by their father Danaes, have
      fled from Egypt and arrived at Argos, to take sanctuary there and to avoid
      capture by their pursuing kinsmen and suitors. In the course of the play,
      the pursuers' ship arrives to reclaim the maidens for a forced wedlock in
      Egypt. The action of the drama turns on the attitude of the king and
      people of Argos, in view of this intended abduction. The king puts the
      question to the popular vote, and the demand of the suitors is unanimously
      rejected: the play closes with thanks and gratitude on the part of the
      fugitives, who, in lyrical strains of quiet beauty, seem to refer the
      whole question of their marriage to the subsequent decision of the gods,
      and, in particular, of Aphrodite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the second portion of the Trilogy we can only speak conjecturally.
      There is a passage in the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> (ll. 860-69), in which
      we learn that the maidens were somehow reclaimed by the suitors, and that
      all, except one, slew their bridegrooms on the wedding night. There is a
      faint trace, among the Fragments of Aeschylus, of a play called <i>Thalamopoioi</i>,&mdash;i.e.
      <i>The Preparers of the Chamber</i>,&mdash;which may well have referred to
      this tragic scene. Its grim title will recall to all classical readers the
      magnificent, though terrible, version of the legend, in the final stanzas
      of the eleventh poem in the third book of Horace's <i>Odes</i>. The final
      play was probably called <i>The Danaides</i>, and described the acquittal
      of the brides through some intervention of Aphrodite: a fragment of it
      survives, in which the goddess appears to be pleading her special
      prerogative. The legends which commit the daughters of Danaus to an
      eternal penalty in Hades are, apparently, of later origin. Homer is silent
      on any such penalty; and Pindar, Aeschylus' contemporary, actually
      describes the once suppliant maidens as honourably enthroned (<i>Pyth</i>.
      ix. 112: <i>Nem</i>. x. ll. 1-10). The Tartarean part of the story is, in
      fact, post-Aeschylean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Suppliant Maidens</i> is full of charm, though the text of the part
      which describes the arrival of the pursuers at Argos is full of
      uncertainties. It remains a fine, though archaic, poem, with this special
      claim on our interest, that it is, probably, the earliest extant poetic
      drama. We see in it the <i>tendency</i> to grandiose language, not yet
      fully developed as in the <i>Prometheus</i>: the inclination of youth to
      simplicity, and even platitude, in religious and general speculation: and
      yet we recognize, as in the germ, the profound theology of the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
      and a touch of the political vein which appears more fully in the <i>Furies</i>.
      If the precedence in time here ascribed to it is correct, the play is
      perhaps worth more recognition than it has received from the countrymen of
      Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Persians</i> has been placed second in this volume, as the oldest
      play whose date is certainly known. It was brought out in 472 B.C., eight
      years after the sea-fight of Salamis which it commemorates, and five years
      before the <i>Seven against Thebes</i> (467 B.C.). It is thought to be the
      second play of a Trilogy, standing between the <i>Phineus</i> and the <i>Glaucus</i>.
      Phineus was a legendary seer, of the Argonautic era&mdash;"Tiresias and
      Phineus, prophets old"&mdash;and the play named after him may have
      contained a prophecy of the great conflict which is actually described in
      <i>The Persae</i>: the plot of the <i>Glaucus</i> is unknown. In any case,
      <i>The Persians</i> was produced before the eyes of a generation which had
      seen the struggles, West against East, at Marathon and Thermopylæ, Salamis
      and Plataea. It is as though Shakespeare had commemorated, through the
      lips of a Spanish survivor, in the ears of old councillors of Philip the
      Second, the dispersal of the Armada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the piteous want of manliness on the part of the returning Xerxes,
      we may well set the grave and dignified patriotism of Atossa, the
      Queen-mother of the Persian kingdom; the loyalty, in spite of their
      bewilderment, of the aged men who form the Chorus; and, above all, the
      royal phantom of Darius, evoked from the shadowland by the libations of
      Atossa and by the appealing cries of the Chorus. The latter, indeed,
      hardly dare to address the kingly ghost: but Atossa bravely narrates to
      him the catastrophe, of which, in the lower world, Darius has known
      nothing, though he realizes that disaster, soon or late, is the lot of
      mortal power. As the tale is unrolled, a spirit of prophecy possesses him,
      and he foretells the coming slaughter of Plataea; then, with a last royal
      admonition that the defeated Xerxes shall, on his return, be received with
      all ceremony and observance, and with a characteristic warning to the aged
      men, that they must take such pleasures as they may, in their waning
      years, he returns to the shades. The play ends with the undignified
      reappearance of Xerxes, and a melancholy procession into the palace of
      Susa. It was, perhaps, inevitable that this close of the great drama
      should verge on the farcical, and that the poltroonery of Xerxes should,
      in a measure, obscure Aeschylus' generous portraiture of Atossa and
      Darius. But his magnificent picture of the battle of Salamis is unequalled
      in the poetic annals of naval war. No account of the flight of the Armada,
      no record of Lepanto or Trafalgar, can be justly set beside it. The
      Messenger might well, like Prospero, announce a tragedy by one line&mdash;

  Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
</pre>
    <p>
      Five years after <i>The Persians</i>, in 467 B. C., the play which we call
      the <i>Seven against Thebes</i> was presented at Athens. It bears now a
      title which Aeschylus can hardly have given to it for, though the scene of
      the drama overlooks the region where the city of Thebes afterwards came
      into being, yet, in the play itself, Thebes is <i>never</i> mentioned. The
      scene of action is the Cadmea, or Citadel of Cadmus, and we know that, in
      Aeschylus' lifetime, that citadel was no longer a mere fastness, but had
      so grown outwards and enlarged itself that a new name, Thebes, was applied
      to the collective city. (All this has been made abundantly clear by Dr.
      Verrall in his Introduction to the <i>Seven against Thebes</i>, to which
      every reader of the play itself will naturally and most profitably refer.)
      In the time of Aeschylus, Thebes was, of course, a notable city, his great
      contemporary Pindar was a citizen of it. But the Thebes of Aeschylus' date
      is one thing, the fortress represented in Aeschylus' play is quite
      another, and is never, by him, called Thebes. That the play received, and
      retains, the name, <i>The Seven against Thebes</i>, is believed to be due
      to two lines of Aristophanes in his <i>Frogs</i> (406 B.C.), where he
      describes Aeschylus' play as "the Seven against Thebes, a drama instinct
      with War, which any one who beheld must have yearned to be a warrior."
      This is rather an excellent <i>description</i> of the play than the title
      of it, and could not be its Aeschylean name, for the very sufficient
      reason that Thebes is not mentioned in the play at all. Aeschylus, in
      fact, was poetizing an earlier legend of the fortress of Cadmus. This
      being premised, we may adopt, under protest as it were, the Aristophanic
      name which has accrued to the play. It is the third part of a Trilogy
      which might have been called, collectively, <i>The House of Laius</i>.
      Sophocles and Euripides give us <i>their</i> versions of the legend, which
      we may epitomize, without, however, affirming that they followed exactly
      the lines of Aeschylus Trilogy&mdash;they, for instance, speak freely of
      <i>Thebes</i>. Laius, King of Thebes, married Iokaste; he was warned by
      Apollo that if he had any children ruin would befall his house. But a
      child was born, and, to avoid the threatened catastrophe, without actually
      killing the child he exposed it on Mount Cithaeron, that it should die.
      Some herdsmen saved it and gave it over to the care of a neighbouring king
      and queen, who reared it. Later on, learning that there was a doubt of his
      parentage, this child, grown now to maturity, left his foster parents and
      went to Delphi to consult the oracle, and received a mysterious and
      terrible warning, that he was fated to slay his father and wed his mother.
      To avoid this horror, he resolved never to approach the home of his
      supposed parents. Meantime his real father, Laius, on <i>his</i> way to
      consult the god at Delphi, met his unknown son returning from that shrine&mdash;a
      quarrel fell out, and the younger man slew the elder. Followed by his evil
      destiny, he wandered on, and found the now kingless Thebes in the grasp of
      the Sphinx monster, over whom he triumphed, and was rewarded by the hand
      of Iokaste, his own mother! Not till four children&mdash;two sons and two
      daughters&mdash;had been born to them, was the secret of the lineage
      revealed. Iokaste slew herself in horror, and the wretched king tore out
      his eyes, that he might never again see the children of his awful union.
      The two sons quarrelled over the succession, then agreed on a compromise;
      then fell at variance again, and finally slew each other in single combat.
      These two sons, according to one tradition, were twins: but the more usual
      view is that the elder was called Eteocles, the younger, Polynices.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the point at which the internecine enmity between Eteocles and
      Polynices arose, we have had to follow Sophocles and Euripides, the first
      two parts of Aeschylus' Trilogy being lost. But the third part, as we have
      said, survives under the name given to it by Aristophanes, the <i>Seven
      against Thebes</i>: it opens with an exhortation by Eteocles to his
      Cadmeans that they should "quit them like men" against the onslaught of
      Polynices and his Argive allies: the Chorus is a bevy of scared Cadmean
      maidens, to whom the very sound of war and tramp of horsemen are new and
      terrific. It ends with the news of the death of the two princes, and the
      lamentations of their two sisters, Antigone and Ismene. The onslaught from
      without has been repulsed, but the male line of the house of Laius is
      extinct. The Cadmeans resolve that Eteocles shall be buried in honour, and
      Polynices flung to the dogs and birds. Against the latter sentence
      Antigone protests, and defies the decree: the Chorus, as is natural, are
      divided in their sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to note that, in combination with the <i>Laius</i> and
      the <i>Oedipus</i>, this play won the dramatic crown in 467 B.C. On the
      other hand, so excellent a judge as Mr. Gilbert Murray thinks that it is
      "perhaps among Aeschylus' plays the one that bears least the stamp of
      commanding genius." Perhaps the daring, practically atheistic, character
      of Eteocles; the battle-fever that burns and thrills through the play; the
      pathetic terror of the Chorus&mdash;may have given it favour, in Athenian
      eyes, as the work of a poet who&mdash;though recently (468 B.C.) defeated
      in the dramatic contest by the young Sophocles&mdash;was yet present to
      tell, not by mere report, the tale of Marathon and Salamis. Or the
      preceding plays, the <i>Laius</i> and the <i>Oedipus</i>, may have been of
      such high merit as to make up for defects observable in the one that still
      survives. In any case, we can hardly err in accepting Dr. Verral's
      judgment that "the story of Aeschylus may be, and in the outlines probably
      is, the genuine epic legend of the Cadmean war."
    </p>
    <p>
      There remains one Aeschylean play, the most famous&mdash;unless we except
      the <i>Agamemnon</i>&mdash;in extant Greek literature, the <i>Prometheus
      Bound</i>. That it was the first of a Trilogy, and that the second and
      third parts were called the <i>Prometheus Freed</i>, and <i>Prometheus the
      Fire-Bearer</i>, respectively, is accepted: but the date of its
      performance is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Prometheus Bound</i> is conspicuous for its gigantic and strictly
      superhuman plot. The <i>Agamemnon</i> is human, though legendary the <i>Prometheus</i>
      presents to us the gods of Olympus in the days when mankind crept like
      emmets upon the earth or dwelt in caves, scorned by Zeus and the other
      powers of heaven, and&mdash;still aided by Prometheus the Titan&mdash;wholly
      without art or science, letters or handicrafts. For his benevolence
      towards oppressed mankind, Prometheus is condemned by Zeus to uncounted
      ages of pain and torment, shackled and impaled in a lonely cleft of a
      Scythian precipice. The play opens with this act of divine resentment
      enforced by the will of Zeus and by the handicraft of Hephaestus, who is
      aided by two demons, impersonating Strength and Violence. These agents if
      the ire of Zeus disappear after the first scene, the rest of the play
      represents Prometheus in the mighty solitude, but visited after a while by
      a Chorus of sea nymphs who, from the distant depths of ocean, have heard
      the clang of the demons' hammers, and arrive, in a winged car, from the
      submarine palace of their father Oceanus. To them Prometheus relates his
      penalty and its cause: viz., his over tenderness to the luckless race of
      mankind. Oceanus himself follows on a hippogriff, and counsels Prometheus
      to submit to Zeus. But the Titan who has handled the sea nymphs with all
      gentleness, receives the advice with scorn and contempt, and Oceanus
      retires. But the courage which he lacks his daughters possess to the full;
      they remain by Prometheus to the end, and share his fate, literally in the
      crack of doom. But before the end, the strange half human figure of Io,
      victim of the lust of Zeus and the jealousy of Hera, comes wandering by,
      and tells Prometheus of her wrongs. He, by his divine power, recounts to
      her not only the past but also the future of her wanderings. Then, in a
      fresh access of frenzy, she drifts away into the unknown world. Then
      Prometheus partly reveals to the sea maidens his secret, and the
      mysterious cause of Zeus' hatred against him&mdash;a cause which would
      avail to hurl the tyrant from his power. So deadly is this secret, that
      Zeus will, in the lapse of ages, be forced to reconcile himself with
      Prometheus, to escape dethronement. Finally, Hermes, the messenger of
      Zeus, appears with fresh threats, that he may extort the mystery from the
      Titan. But Prometheus is firm, defying both the tyrant and his envoy,
      though already the lightning is flashing, the thunder rolling, and sky and
      sea are mingling their fury. Hermes can say no more; the sea nymphs
      resolutely refuse to retire, and wait their doom. In this crash of the
      world, Prometheus flings his final defiance against Zeus, and amid the
      lightnings and shattered rocks that are overwhelming him and his
      companions, speaks his last word, "<i>It is unjust</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Any spectacular representation of this finale must, it is clear, have
      roused intense sympathy with the Titan and the nymphs alike. If, however,
      the sequel-plays had survived to us, we might conceivably have found and
      realized another and less intolerable solution. The name <i>Zeus</i>, in
      Greek, like that of <i>God</i>, in English, comprises very diverse views
      of divine personality. The Zeus in the <i>Prometheus</i> has little but
      the name in common with the Zeus in the first chorus of the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
      or in <i>The Suppliant Maidens</i> (ll. 86-103): and parallel reflections
      will give us much food for thought. But, in any case, let us realize that
      the <i>Prometheus</i> is not a human play: with the possible exception of
      Io, every character in it is an immortal being. It is not as a vaunt, but
      as a fact, that Prometheus declares, as against Zeus (l. 1053), that "Me
      at least He shall never give to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      A stupendous theological drama of which two-thirds has been lost has left
      an aching void, which now can never be filled, in our minds. No reader of
      poetry needs to be reminded of the glorious attempt of Shelley to work out
      a possible and worthy sequel to the <i>Prometheus</i>. Who will not echo
      the words of Mr. Gilbert Murray, when he says that "no piece of lost
      literature has been more ardently longed for than the <i>Prometheus Freed</i>"?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at the end of a rather prolonged attempt to understand and translate
      the surviving tragedies of Aeschylus, one feels inclined to repeat the
      words used by a powerful critic about one of the greatest of modern poets&mdash;"For
      man, it is a weary way to God, but a wearier far to any demigod." We shall
      not discover the full sequel of Aeschylus' mighty dramatic conception: we
      "know in part, and we prophesy in part." The Introduction (pp.

      DEDICATION
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Take thou this gift from out the grave of Time.
  The urns of Greece lie shattered, and the cup
  That for Athenian lips the Muses filled,
  And flowery crowns that on Athenian hair
  Hid the cicala, freedom's golden sign,
  Dust in the dust have fallen. Calmly sad,
  The marble dead upon Athenian tombs
  Speak from their eyes "Farewell": and well have fared
  They and the saddened friends, whose clasping hands
  Win from the solemn stone eternity.
  Yea, well they fared unto the evening god,
  Passing beyond the limit of the world,
  Where face to face the son his mother saw,
  A living man a shadow, while she spake
  Words that Odysseus and that Homer heard,&mdash;
  <i>I too, O child, I reached the common doom,
  The grave, the goal of fate, and passed away</i>.
  &mdash;Such, Anticleia, as thy voice to him,
  Across the dim gray gulf of death and time
  Is that of Greece, a mother's to a child,&mdash;
  Mother of each whose dreams are grave and fair&mdash;
  Who sees the Naiad where the streams are bright
  And in the sunny ripple of the sea
  Cymodoce with floating golden hair:
  And in the whisper of the waving oak
  Hears still the Dryad's plaint, and, in the wind
  That sighs through moonlit woodlands, knows the horn
  Of Artemis, and silver shafts and bow.
  Therefore if still around this broken vase,
  Borne by rough hands, unworthy of their load,
  Far from Cephisus and the wandering rills,
  There cling a fragrance as of things once sweet,
  Of honey from Hymettus' desert hill,
  Take thou the gift and hold it close and dear;
  For gifts that die have living memories&mdash;
  Voices of unreturning days, that breathe
  The spirit of a day that never dies.

      ARGUMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Io, the daughter of Inachus, King of Argos, was beloved of Zeus. But Hera
      was jealous of that love, and by her ill will was Io given over to frenzy,
      and her body took the semblance of a heifer: and Argus, a many-eyed
      herdsman, was set by Hera to watch Io whithersoever she strayed. Yet, in
      despite of Argus, did Zeus draw nigh unto her in the shape of a bull. And
      by the will of Zeus and the craft of Hermes was Argus slain. Then Io was
      driven over far lands and seas by her madness, and came at length to the
      land of Egypt. There was she restored to herself by a touch of the hand of
      Zeus, and bare a child called Epaphus. And from Epaphus sprang Libya, and
      from Libya, Belus; and from Belus, Aegyptus and Danaus. And the sons of
      Aegyptus willed to take the daughters of Danaus in marriage. But the
      maidens held such wedlock in horror, and fled with their father over the
      sea to Argos; and the king and citizens of Argos gave them shelter and
      protection from their pursuers.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  ZEUS! Lord and guard of suppliant hands!
    Look down benign on us who crave
    Thine aid&mdash;whom winds and waters drave
  From where, through drifting shifting sands,
    Pours Nilus to the wave.
  From where the green land, god-possest,
  Closes and fronts the Syrian waste,
  We flee as exiles, yet unbanned
  By murder's sentence from our land;
  But&mdash;since Aegyptus had decreed
  His sons should wed his brother's seed,&mdash;
  Ourselves we tore from bonds abhorred,
  From wedlock not of heart but hand,
  Nor brooked to call a kinsman lord!
  And Danaus, our sire and guide,
  The king of counsel, pond'ring well
  The dice of fortune as they fell,
  Out of two griefs the kindlier chose,
  And bade us fly, with him beside,
  Heedless what winds or waves arose,
  And o'er the wide sea waters haste,
  Until to Argos' shore at last
    Our wandering pinnace came&mdash;
  Argos, the immemorial home
  Of her from whom we boast to come&mdash;
  Io, the ox-horned maiden, whom,
  After long wandering, woe, and scathe,
  Zeus with a touch, a mystic breath,
    Made mother of our name.
  Therefore, of all the lands of earth,
  On this most gladly step we forth,
  And in our hands aloft we bear&mdash;
  Sole weapon for a suppliant's wear&mdash;
  The olive-shoot, with wool enwound!
    City, and land, and waters wan
  Of Inachus, and gods most high,
  And ye who, deep beneath the ground,
  Bring vengeance weird on mortal man,
  Powers of the grave, on you we cry!
  And unto Zeus the Saviour, guard
  Of mortals' holy purity!
  Receive ye us&mdash;keep watch and ward
  Above the suppliant maiden band!
  Chaste be the heart of this your land
  Towards the weak! but, ere the throng,
  The wanton swarm, from Egypt sprung,
  Leap forth upon the silted shore,
  Thrust back their swift-rowed bark again,
  Repel them, urge them to the main!
  And there, 'mid storm and lightning's shine,
  And scudding drift and thunder's roar,
  Deep death be theirs, in stormy brine!
  Before they foully grasp and win
  Us, maiden-children of their kin,
  And climb the couch by law denied,
  And wrong each weak reluctant bride.
    And now on her I call,

  Mine ancestress, who far on Egypt's shore
      A young cow's semblance wore,&mdash;
  A maiden once, by Hera's malice changed!
      And then on him withal,
  Who, as amid the flowers the grazing creature
      ranged,
  Was in her by a breath of Zeus conceived;
      And, as the hour of birth drew nigh,
  By fate fulfilled, unto the light he came;
      And Epaphus for name,
  Born from the touch of Zeus, the child received.
      On him, on him I cry,
      And him for patron hold&mdash;
    While in this grassy vale I stand,
      Where lo roamed of old!
  And here, recounting all her toil and pain,
  Signs will I show to those who rule the land
 That I am child of hers; and all shall understand,
 Hearing the doubtful tale of the dim past made plain.
        And, ere the end shall be,
  Each man the truth of what I tell shall see.
        And if there dwell hard by
  One skilled to read from bird-notes augury,
 That man, when through his ears shall thrill our
      tearful wail,
  Shall deem he hears the voice, the plaintive tale
 Of her, the piteous spouse of Tereus, lord of guile&mdash;
 Whom the hawk harries yet, the mourning nightingale.
 She, from her happy home and fair streams scared
      away,
    Wails wild and sad for haunts beloved erewhile.
    Yea, and for Itylus&mdash;ah, well-a-day!
      Slain by her own, his mother's hand,
 Maddened by lustful wrong, the deed by Tereus
      planned.
 Like her I wail and wail, in soft Ionian tones,
      And as she wastes, even so
  Wastes my soft cheek, once ripe with Nilus' suns
  And all my heart dissolves in utter woe
      Sad flowers of grief I cull,

  Fleeing from kinsmen's love unmerciful&mdash;
 Yea, from the clutching hands, the wanton crowd,
 I sped across the waves, from Egypt's land of cloud{1}

    <p>
      {Footnote: 1: <i>AeRas apogas</i> This epithet may appear strange to
      modern readers accustomed to think of Egypt as a land of cloudless skies
      and pellucid atmosphere. Nevertheless both Pindar (<i>Pyth</i> iv 93) and
      Apollonius Rhodius (iv 267) speak of it in the same way as Aeschylus. It
      has been conjectured that they allude to the fog banks that often obscure
      the low coasts&mdash;a phenomenon likely to impress the early navigators
      and to be reported by them.}

  Gods of the ancient cradle of my race,
  Hear me, just gods! With righteous grace
      On me, on me look down!
 Grant not to youth its heart's unchaste desire,
 But, swiftly spurning lust's unholy fire,
  Bless only love and willing wedlock's crown

  Find refuge at the hallowed altar-side,
      The sanctuary divine,&mdash;
  Ye gods! such refuge unto me provide&mdash;

  A beacon in the dark, 'mid clouds of chance
        That wrap mankind
 Yea, though the counsel fall, undone it shall not be,
 Whate'er be shaped and fixed within Zeus' ruling mind&mdash;
 Dark as a solemn grove, with sombre leafage shaded,

 Smitten by him, from towering hopes degraded,

 Tireless and effortless, works forth its will

 God from His holy seat, in calm of unarmed power,
 Brings forth the deed, at its appointed hour!

  My sorrow's words, my shrill and tearful cries!
        Ah woe, ah woe!
    Loud with lament the accents use,
 And from my living lips my own sad dirges flow!
       O Apian land of hill and dale,
 Thou kennest yet, O land, this faltered foreign wail&mdash;
       Have mercy, hear my prayer!
  Lo, how again, again, I rend and tear
  My woven raiment, and from off my hair
       Cast the Sidonian veil!

 Ah, but if fortune smile, if death be driven away,
 Vowed rites, with eager haste, we to the gods will pay!
      Alas, alas again!
 O wither drift the waves? and who shall loose the pain?

          O Apian land of hill and dale,
 Thou kennest yet, O land, this faltered foreign wail!
          Have mercy, hear my prayer!
  Lo, how again, again, I rend and tear
  My woven raiment, and from off my hair
          Cast the Sidonian veil!

  The wafting oar, the bark with woven sail,
          From which the sea foamed back,
  Sped me, unharmed of storms, along the breeze's track&mdash;
          Be it unblamed of me!
  But ah, the end, the end of my emprise!
  May He, the Father, with all-seeing eyes,
          Grant me that end to see!
  Grant that henceforth unstained as heretofore
    I may escape the forced embrace
    Of those proud children of the race
          That sacred Io bore.

  And thou, O maiden-goddess chaste and pure&mdash;
          Queen of the inner fane,&mdash;
  Look of thy grace on me, O Artemis,
    Thy willing suppliant&mdash;thine, thine it is,
  Who from the lustful onslaught fled secure,
    To grant that I too without stain
  The shelter of thy purity may gain!

  Grant that henceforth unstained as heretofore
    I may escape the forced embrace
    Of those proud children of the race
           That sacred Io bore!

           Yet if this may not be,
    We, the dark race sun-smitten, we
    Will speed with suppliant wands
  To Zeus who rules below, with hospitable hands
  Who welcomes all the dead from all the lands:
 Yea by our own hands strangled, we will go,
 Spurned by Olympian gods, unto the gods below!

    Zeus, hear and save!
 The searching, poisonous hate, that Io vexed and drave,
  Was of a goddess: well I know
  The bitter ire, the wrathful woe
    Of Hera, queen of heaven&mdash;-
 A storm, a storm her breath, whereby we yet are driven!
    Bethink thee, what dispraise
  Of Zeus himself mankind will raise,
 If now he turn his face averted from our cries!
 If now, dishonoured and alone,
 The ox-horned maiden's race shall be undone,
 Children of Epaphus, his own begotten son&mdash;-
 Zeus, listen from on high!&mdash;to thee our prayers arise.

  And hark, within their grinding sockets ring

  Borne in curved cars, by speeding horses drawn,
  A speared and shielded band. The chiefs, perchance,
  Of this their land are hitherward intent

  A shield that none may cleave. Step swift thereto,
  And in your left hands hold with reverence
  The white-crowned wands of suppliance, the sign
  Beloved of Zeus, compassion's lord, and speak
  To those that question you, words meek and low
  And piteous, as beseems your stranger state,
  Clearly avowing of this flight of yours
  The bloodless cause; and on your utterance
  See to it well that modesty attend;
  From downcast eyes, from brows of pure control,
  Let chastity look forth; nor, when ye speak,
  Be voluble nor eager&mdash;they that dwell
  Within this land are sternly swift to chide.
  And be your words submissive: heed this well;
  For weak ye are, outcasts on stranger lands,

  O stranger maids, I may not trust this word,

  No likeness of our country do ye bear,
  But semblance as of Libyan womankind.
  Even such a stock by Nilus' banks might grow;
  Yea and the Cyprian stamp, in female forms,
  Shows to the life, what males impressed the same.
  And, furthermore, of roving Indian maids
  Whose camping-grounds by Aethiopia lie,
  And camels burdened even as mules, and bearing
  Riders, as horses bear, mine ears have heard;
  And tales of flesh-devouring mateless maids
  Called Amazons: to these, if bows ye bare,

    Unto far lands and alien peoples driven

    Sees, as she goes, the cleaving strait divide
        Greece, from the Eastland riven.
  And swift through Asian borders doth she urge
  Her course, o'er Phrygian mountains' sheep-clipt side;
  Thence, where the Mysian realm of Teuthras lies
    Towards Lydian lowlands hies,
  And o'er Cilician and Pamphylian hills
    And ever-flowing rills,
  And thence to Aphrodite's fertile shore, {5}

  The land of garnered wheat and wealthy store
  And thence, deep-stung by wild unrest,
  By the winged fly that goaded her and drave,
  Unto the fertile land, the god-possest,
      (Where, fed from far-off snows,
      Life-giving Nilus flows,
  Urged on by Typho's strength, a fertilizing wave)
  She roves, in harassed and dishonoured flight
  Scathed by the  blasting pangs of Hera's dread despite.
      And they within the land
      With terror shook and wanned,
  So strange the sight they saw, and were afraid&mdash;
  A wild twy-natured thing, half heifer and half maid.
  Whose hand was laid at last on Io, thus forlorn,
    With many roamings worn?
  Who bade the harassed maiden's peace return?
    Zeus, lord of time eterne.
  Yea, by his breath divine, by his unscathing strength,
      She lays aside her bane,
  And softened back to womanhood at length
      Sheds human tears again.
  Then, quickened with Zeus' veritable seed,
      A progeny she bare,
  A stainless babe, a child of heavenly breed.
      Of life and fortune fair.
  <i>His is the life of life</i>&mdash;so all men say,&mdash;
    <i>His is the seed of Zeus.
  Who else had power stern Hera's craft to stay,

      Justly his deed was done;
      Unto what other one,
 Of all the gods, should I for justice turn?
      From him our race did spring;
      Creator he and King,
 Ancient of days and wisdom he, and might.
      As bark before the wind,
      So, wafted by his mind,
 Moves every counsel, each device aright.
      Beneath no stronger hand
      Holds he a weak command,
 No throne doth he abase him to adore;
      Swift as a word, his deed
      Acts out what stands decreed
 In counsels of his heart, for evermore.

  Such things the Argive people heard, and straight,
  Without proclaim of herald, gave assent:
  Yea, in full conclave, the Pelasgian folk
  Heard suasive pleas, and Zeus through them resolved.

      CHORUS

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Arouse we now to chant our prayer
  For fair return of service fair
    And Argos' kindly will.
  Zeus, lord of guestright, look upon
  The grace our stranger lips have won.
  In right and truth, as they begun,
  Guide them, with favouring hand, until
  Thou dost their blameless wish fulfil!

    Now may the Zeus-born gods on high
      Hear us pour forth
    A votive prayer for Argos' clan!&mdash;
    Never may this Pelasgian earth,
  Amid the fire-wrack, shrill the dismal cry
    On Ares, ravening lord of fight,
  Who in an alien harvest mows down man!
    For lo, this land had pity on our plight,
  And unto us were merciful and leal,
  To us, the piteous flock, who at Zeus' altar kneel!
  They scornèd not the pleas of maidenhood,
  Nor with the young men's will hath their will stood.
      They knew right well.

  Th' unearthly watching fiend invincible,
  The foul avenger&mdash;let him not draw near!
  For he, on roofs ill-starred,
  Defiling and polluting, keeps a ghastly ward!
  They knew his vengeance, and took holy heed
  To us, the sister suppliants, who cry
    To Zeus, the lord of purity:
  Therefore with altars pure they shall the gods revere.

  Thus, through the boughs that shade our lips, fly forth in air,
      Fly forth, O eager prayer!
    May never pestilence efface
      This city's race,
    Nor be the land with corpses strewed,
      Nor stained with civic blood!
    The stem of youth, unpluckt, to manhood come,
    Nor Ares rise from Aphrodité's bower,
  The lord of death and bane, to waste our youthful flower.
        Long may the old
    Crowd to the altars kindled to consume
        Gifts rich and manifold&mdash;
    Offered to win from powers divine
    A benison on city and on shrine:
      Let all the sacred might adore
        Of Zeus most high, the lord
      Of guestright and the hospitable board,
  Whose immemorial law doth rule Fate's scales aright:
        The garners of earth's store
        Be full for evermore,
  And grace of Artemis make women's travail light;
    No devastating curse of fell disease
        This city seize;
    No clamour of the State arouse to war
        Ares, from whom afar
    Shrinketh the lute, by whom the dances fail&mdash;
        Ares, the lord of wail.
    Swarm far aloof from Argos' citizens
        All plague and pestilence,
    And may the Archer-God our children spare!
    May Zeus with foison and with fruitfulness
        The land's each season bless,
    And, quickened with Heaven's bounty manifold,
        Teem grazing flock and fold.
    Beside the altars of Heaven's hallowing
        Loud let the minstrels sing,
  And from pure lips float forth the harp-led strain in air!
    And let the people's voice, the power
    That sways the State, in danger's hour
      Be wary, wise for all;
    Nor honour in dishonour hold,
    But&mdash;ere the voice of war be bold&mdash;
    Let them to stranger peoples grant
    Fair and unbloody covenant&mdash;
      Justice and peace withal;
    And to the Argive powers divine
    The sacrifice of laurelled kine,
      By rite ancestral, pay.
    Among three words of power and awe,
    Stands this, the third, the mighty law&mdash;
    <i>Your gods, your fathers deified,
    Ye shall adore</i>. Let this abide
      For ever and for aye.

  Dear children, well and wisely have ye prayed;
  I bid you now not shudder, though ye hear
  New and alarming tidings from your sire.
  From this high place beside the suppliants' shrine
  The bark of our pursuers I behold,
  By divers tokens recognized too well.
  Lo, the spread canvas and the hides that screen
  The gunwale; lo, the prow, with painted eyes
  That seem her onward pathway to descry,
  Heeding too well the rudder at the stern
  That rules her, coming for no friendly end.
  And look, the seamen&mdash;all too plain their race&mdash;
  Their dark limbs gleam from out their snow-white garb;
  Plain too the other barks, a fleet that comes
  All swift to aid the purpose of the first,
  That now, with furled sail and with pulse of oars
  Which smite the wave together, comes aland.
  But ye, be calm, and, schooled not scared by fear,
  Confront this chance, be mindful of your trust
  In these protecting gods. And I will hence,
  And champions who shall plead your cause aright
  Will bring unto your side. There come perchance
  Heralds or envoys, eager to lay hand
  And drag you captive hence; yet fear them not;
  Foiled shall they be. Yet well it were for you
  (If, ere with aid I come, I tarry long),
  Not by one step this sanctuary to leave.
  Farewell, fear nought: soon shall the hour be born
  When he that scorns the gods shall rue his scorn

  O land of hill and dale, O holy land,
  What shall befall us? whither shall we flee,
  From Apian land to some dark lair of earth?

  O would that in vapour of smoke I might rise to the
      clouds of the sky,
  That as dust which flits up without wings I might pass
      and evanish and die!
  I dare not, I dare not abide: my heart yearns, eager
      to fly;
  And  dark is the cast of my thought;  I shudder and
      tremble for fear.
  My father looked forth and beheld:  I die of the sight
      that draws near.
  And for me be the strangling cord, the halter made
      ready by Fate,
  Before to my body draws nigh the man of my horror
      and hate.
  Nay,  ere  I will own him as lord, as handmaid to
      Hades I go!
  And oh, that aloft in the sky, where the dark clouds
      are frozen to snow,
  A refuge for me might be found, or a mountain-top
      smooth and too high

  For the foot of the goat, where the vulture sits lonely,
     and none may descry
  The  pinnacle veiled in the cloud,
      the highest and sheerest of all,
  Ere to wedlock that rendeth my heart,
      and love that is loveless, I fall!
  Yea, a prey to the dogs and the birds of the mount

  From wailing and curse and pollution it is death,
      only death, sets me free:
  Let death come upon me before
      to the ravisher's bed I am thrust;
  What champion, what saviour but death can I find,
      or what refuge from lust?
  I will utter my shriek of entreaty,
      a prayer that shrills up to the sky,
  That calleth  the gods  to  compassion,
      a tuneful, a pitiful cry,
  That is loud to invoke the releaser.
      O father, look down on the fight;
  Look down in thy wrath on the wronger,
      with eyes that are eager for right.
  Zeus, thou that art lord of the world,
      whose kingdom is strong over all,
  Have mercy on us! At thine altar for refuge
      and safety we call.
  For the race of Aegyptus is fierce,
      with greed and with malice afire;
  They cry as the questing hounds,
      they sweep with the speed of desire.
  But thine is the balance of fate,
      thou rulest the wavering scale,
  And without thee no mortal emprise
      shall have strength to achieve or prevail.

    Alack, alack! the ravisher&mdash;
  He leaps from boat to beach, he draweth near!

  Ah, ah, the touch, the prelude of my shame.

  That honoured I might walk, nor unaware
  Die by some secret thrust and on this land
  Bring down the curse of death, that dieth not.
  Such boons they gave me: it behoves me pay
  A deeper reverence from a soul sincere.
  Ye, to the many words of wariness
  Spoken by me your father, add this word,
  That, tried by time, our unknown company
  Be held for honest: over-swift are tongues
  To slander strangers, over-light is speech
  To bring pollution on a stranger's name.
  Therefore I rede you, bring no shame on me
  Now when man's eye beholds your maiden prime.
  Lovely is beauty's ripening harvest-field,
  But ill to guard; and men and beasts, I wot,
  And birds and creeping things make prey of it.
  And when the fruit is ripe for love, the voice
  Of Aphrodite bruiteth it abroad,
  The while she guards the yet unripened growth.
  On the fair richness of a maiden's bloom
  Each passer looks, o'ercome with strong desire,
  With eyes that waft the wistful dart of love.
  Then be not such our hap, whose livelong toil
  Did make our pinnace plough the mighty main:
  Nor bring we shame upon ourselves, and joy
  Unto my foes. Behold, a twofold home&mdash;
  One of the king's and one the people's gift&mdash;
  Unbought, 'tis yours to hold,&mdash;a gracious boon.
  Go&mdash;but remember ye your sire's behest,
  And hold your life less dear than chastity.

      ARGUMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Xerxes, son of Darius and of his wife Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, went
      forth against Hellas, to take vengeance upon those who had defeated his
      father at Marathon. But ill fortune befell the king and his army both by
      land and sea; neither did it avail him that he cast a bridge over the
      Hellespont and made a canal across the promontory of Mount Athos, and
      brought myriads of men, by land and sea, to subdue the Greeks. For in the
      strait between Athens and the island of Salamis the Persian ships were
      shattered and sunk or put to flight by those of Athens and Lacedaemon and
      Aegina and Corinth, and Xerxes went homewards on the way by which he had
      come, leaving his general Mardonius with three hundred thousand men to
      strive with the Greeks by land: but in the next year they were destroyed
      near Plataea in Boeotia, by the Lacedaemonians and Athenians and Tegeans.
      Such was the end of the army which Xerxes left behind him. But the king
      himself had reached the bridge over the Hellespont, and late and hardly
      and in sorry plight and with few companions came home unto the Palace of
      Susa.

      CHORUS

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Away unto the Grecian land
  Hath passed the Persian armament:
  We, by the monarch's high command,
  We are the warders true who stand,
  Chosen, for honour and descent,
  To watch the wealth of him who went&mdash;
  Guards of the gold, and faithful styled
  By Xerxes, great Darius' child!

  But the king went nor comes again&mdash;
  And for that host, we saw depart
  Arrayed in gold, my boding heart
  Aches with a pulse of anxious pain,
  Presageful for its youthful king!
  No scout, no steed, no battle-car
  Comes speeding hitherward, to bring
  News to our city from afar!
  Erewhile they went, away, away,
  From Susa, from Ecbatana,
  From Kissa's timeworn fortress grey,
  Passing to ravage and to war&mdash;
  Some upon steeds, on galleys some,
  Some in close files, they passed from home,
  All upon warlike errand bent&mdash;
  Amistres, Artaphernes went,
  Astaspes, Megabazes high,
  Lords of the Persian chivalry,
  Marshals who serve the great king's word
  Chieftains of all the mighty horde!
  Horsemen and bowmen streamed away,
  Grim in their aspect, fixed to slay,
  And resolute to face the fray!
  With troops of horse, careering fast,
  Masistes, Artembáres passed:
  Imaeus too, the bowman brave,
  Sosthánes, Pharandákes, drave&mdash;
  And others the all-nursing wave
  Of Nilus to the battle gave;
  Came Susiskánes, warrior wild,
  And Pegastágon, Egypt's child:
  Thee, brave Arsámes! from afar
  Did holy Memphis launch to war;
  And Ariomardus, high in fame,
  From Thebes the immemorial came,
  And oarsmen skilled from Nilus' fen,
  A countless crowd of warlike men:
  And next, the dainty Lydians went&mdash;
  Soft rulers of a continent&mdash;
  Mitragathes and Arcteus bold
  In twin command their ranks controlled,
  And Sardis town, that teems with gold,
  Sent forth its squadrons to the war&mdash;
  Horse upon horse, and car on car,
  Double and triple teams, they rolled,
  In onset awful to behold.
  From Tmolus' sacred hill there came
  The native hordes to join the fray,
  And upon Hellas' neck to lay
  The yoke of slavery and shame;
  Mardon and Tharubis were there,
  Bright anvils for the foemen's spear!
  The Mysian dart-men sped to war,
  And the long crowd that onward rolled
  From Babylon enriched with gold&mdash;
  Captains of ships and archers skilled
  To speed the shaft, and those who wield
  The scimitar;&mdash;the eastern band
  Who, by the great king's high command,
  Swept to subdue the western land!

  Gone are they, gone&mdash;ah, welladay!
  The flower and pride of our array;
  And all the Eastland, from whose breast
  Came forth her bravest and her best,
  Craves longingly with boding dread&mdash;
  Parents for sons, and brides new-wed
  For absent lords, and, day by day,
  Shudder with dread at their delay!

  Ere now they have passed o'er the sea,
      the manifold host of the king&mdash;
  They have gone forth to sack and to burn;
      ashore on the Westland they spring!
  With cordage and rope they have bridged
      the sea-way of Helle, to pass
  O'er the strait that is named by thy name,
      O daughter of Athamas!
  They have anchored their ships in the current,
      they have bridled the neck of the sea&mdash;
  The Shepherd and Lord of the East
      hath bidden a roadway to be!
  From the land to the land they pass over,
      a herd at the high king's best;
  Some by the way of the waves,
      and some o'er the planking have pressed.
  For the king is a lord and a god:
      he was born of the golden seed
  That erst upon Danae fell&mdash;
      his captains are strong at the need!
  And dark is the glare of his eyes,
      as eyes of a serpent blood-fed,
  And with manifold troops in his train
      and with manifold ships hath he sped&mdash;
  Yea, sped with his Syrian cars:
      he leads on the lords of the bow
  To meet with the men of the West,
      the spear-armed force of the foe!
  Can any make head and resist him,
      when he comes with the roll of a wave?
  No barrier nor phalanx of might,
      no chief, be he ever so brave!
  For stern is the onset of Persia,
      and gallant her children in fight.
  But the guile of the god is deceitful,
      and who shall elude him by flight?
  And who is the lord of the leap,
      that can spring and alight and evade?
  For Até deludes and allures,
      till round him the meshes are laid,
  And no man his doom can escape!
      it was writ in the rule of high Heaven,
  That in tramp of the steeds and in crash of the charge
      the war-cry of Persia be given:
  They have learned to behold the forbidden,
      the sacred enclosure of sea,
  Where the waters are wide and in stress
      of the wind the billows roll hoary to lee!
  And their trust is in cable and cordage,
      too weak in the power of the blast,
  And frail are the links of the bridge
     whereby unto Hellas they passed.

  Therefore my gloom-wrapped heart
    is rent with sorrow
    For what may hap to-morrow!
  Alack, for all the Persian armament&mdash;
   Alack, lest there be sent
  Dread news of desolation, Susa's land
    Bereft, forlorn, unmanned&mdash;
  Lest the grey Kissian fortress echo back
    The wail, <i>Alack, Alack</i>!
  The sound of women's shriek, who wail and mourn,
    With fine-spun raiment torn!
  The charioteers went forth nor come again,
    And all the marching men
  Even as a swarm of bees have flown afar,
    Drawn by the king to war&mdash;
  Crossing the sea-bridge, linked from side to side,
    That doth the waves divide:
  And the soft bridal couch of bygone years
    Is now bedewed with tears,
  Each princess, clad in garments delicate,
    Wails for her widowed fate&mdash;

  <i>Alas my gallant bridegroom, lost and gone,
    And I am left alone</i>!

  But now, ye warders of the state,
  Here, in this hall of old renown,
  Behoves that we deliberate
  In counsel deep and wise debate,
    For need is surely shown!
  How fareth he, Darius' child,
  The Persian king, from Perseus styled?

  Comes triumph to the eastern bow,
  Or hath the lance-point conquered now?
                                                {<i>Enter</i> ATOSSA.
  See, yonder comes the mother-queen,
  Light of our eyes, in godlike sheen,
  The royal mother of the king!&mdash;
  Fall we before her! well it were
  That, all as one, we sue to her,
  And round her footsteps cling!

  Queen, among deep-girded Persian dames thou highest and most royal,
  Hoary mother, thou, of Xerxes, and Darius' wife of old!
  To godlike sire, and godlike son, we bow us and are loyal&mdash;

  Long while by various visions of the night
  Am I beset, since to Ionian lands
  With marshalled host my son went forth to war.
  Yet never saw I presage so distinct
  As in the night now passed.&mdash;Attend my tale!&mdash;
  A dream I had: two women nobly clad
  Came to my sight, one robed in Persian dress,
  The other vested in the Dorian garb,
  And both right stately and more tall by far
  Than women of to-day, and beautiful
  Beyond disparagement, and sisters sprung
  Both of one race, but, by their natal lot,
  One born in Hellas, one in Eastern land.
  These, as it seemed unto my watching eyes,
  Roused each the other to a mutual feud:
  The which my son perceiving set himself
  To check and soothe their struggle, and anon
  Yoked them and set the collars on their necks;
  And one, the Ionian, proud in this array,
  Paced in high quietude, and lent her mouth,
  Obedient, to the guidance of the rein.
  But restively the other strove, and broke
  The fittings of the car, and plunged away
  With mouth un-bitted: o'er the broken yoke
  My son was hurled, and lo! Darius stood
  In lamentation o'er his fallen child.
  Him Xerxes saw, and rent his robe in grief.

  Such was my vision of the night now past;
  But when, arising, I had dipped my hand
  In the fair lustral stream, I drew towards
  The altar, in the act of sacrifice,
  Having in mind to offer, as their due,
  The sacred meal-cake to the averting powers,
  Lords of the rite that banisheth ill dreams.
  When lo! I saw an eagle fleeing fast
  To Phoebus' shrine&mdash;O friends, I stayed my steps,
  Too scared to speak! for, close upon his flight,
  A little falcon dashed in winged pursuit,
  Plucking with claws the eagle's head, while he
  Could only crouch and cower and yield himself.
  Scared was I by that sight, and eke to you
  No less a terror must it be to hear!
  For mark this well&mdash;if Xerxes have prevailed,
  He shall come back the wonder of the world:
  If not, still none can call him to account&mdash;

  O queen, our whole disaster thus befell,
  Through intervention of some fiend or fate&mdash;
  I know not what&mdash;that had ill will to us.
  From the Athenian host some Greek came o'er,
  To thy son Xerxes whispering this tale&mdash;
  <i>Once let the gloom of night have gathered in,
  The Greeks will tarry not, but swiftly spring
  Each to his galley-bench, in furtive flight,
  Softly contriving safety for their life</i>.
  Thy son believed the word and missed the craft
  Of that Greek foeman, and the spite of Heaven,
  And straight to all his captains gave this charge&mdash;
  <i>As soon as sunlight warms the ground no more,
  And gloom enwraps the sanctuary of sky,
  Range we our fleet in triple serried lines
  To bar the passage from the seething strait,
  This way and that: let other ships surround
  The isle of Ajax, with this warning word&mdash;
  That if the Greeks their jeopardy should scape
  By wary craft, and win their ships a road.
  Each Persian captain shall his failure pay
  By forfeit of his head</i>. So spake the king,
  Inspired at heart with over-confidence,
  Unwitting of the gods' predestined will.
  Thereon our crews, with no disordered haste,
  Did service to his bidding and purveyed
  The meal of afternoon: each rower then
  Over the fitted rowlock looped his oar.
  Then, when the splendour of the sun had set,
  And night drew on, each master of the oar
  And each armed warrior straightway went aboard.
  Forward the long ships moved, rank cheering rank,
  Each forward set upon its ordered course.
  And all night long the captains of the fleet
  Kept their crews moving up and down the strait.
  So the night waned, and not one Grecian ship
  Made effort to elude and slip away.
  But as dawn came and with her coursers white
  Shone in fair radiance over all the earth,
  First from the Grecian fleet rang out a cry,
  A song of onset! and the island crags
  Re-echoed to the shrill exulting sound.
  Then on us Eastern men amazement fell
  And fear in place of hope; for what we heard
  Was not a call to flight! the Greeks rang out
  Their holy, resolute, exulting chant,
  Like men come forth to dare and do and die
  Their trumpets pealed, and fire was in that sound,
  And with the dash of simultaneous oars
  Replying to the war-chant, on they came,
  Smiting the swirling brine, and in a trice
  They flashed upon the vision of the foe!
  The right wing first in orderly advance
  Came on, a steady column; following then,
  The rest of their array moved out and on,
  And to our ears there came a burst of sound,
  A clamour manifold.&mdash;<i>On, sons of Greece!
  On, for your country's freedom! strike to save
  Wives, children, temples of ancestral gods,
  Graves of your fathers! now is all at stake</i>.
  Then from our side swelled up the mingled din
  Of Persian tongues, and time brooked no delay&mdash;
  Ship into ship drave hard its brazen beak
  With speed of thought, a shattering blow! and first
  One Grecian bark plunged straight, and sheared away
  Bowsprit and stem of a Phoenician ship.
  And then each galley on some other's prow
  Came crashing in. Awhile our stream of ships
  Held onward, till within the narrowing creek
  Our jostling vessels were together driven,
  And none could aid another: each on each
  Drave hard their brazen beaks, or brake away
  The oar-banks of each other, stem to stern,
  While the Greek galleys, with no lack of skill,
  Hemmed them and battered in their sides, and soon
  The hulls rolled over, and the sea was hid,
  Crowded with wrecks and butchery of men.
  No beach nor reef but was with corpses strewn,
  And every keel of our barbarian host
  Hurried to flee, in utter disarray.
  Thereon the foe closed in upon the wrecks
  And hacked and hewed, with oars and splintered planks,
  As fishermen hack tunnies or a cast
  Of netted dolphins, and the briny sea
  Rang with the screams and shrieks of dying men,
  Until the night's dark aspect hid the scene.
  Had I a ten days' time to sum that count
  Of carnage, 'twere too little! know this well&mdash;
  One day ne'er saw such myriad forms of death!

  An islet is there, fronting Salamis&mdash;
  Strait, and with evil anchorage: thereon
  Pan treads the measure of the dance he loves
  Along the sea-beach. Thither the king sent
  His noblest, that, whene'er the Grecian foe
  Should 'scape, with shattered ships, unto the isle,
  We might make easy prey of fugitives
  And slay them there, and from the washing tides
  Rescue our friends. It fell out otherwise
  Than he divined, for when, by aid of Heaven,
  The Hellenes held the victory on the sea,
  Their sailors then and there begirt themselves
  With brazen mail and bounded from their ships,
  And then enringed the islet, point by point,
  So that our Persians in bewilderment
  Knew not which way to turn.  On every side,
  Battered with stones, they fell, while arrows flew
  From many a string, and smote them to the death.
  Then, at the last, with simultaneous rush
  The foe came bursting on us, hacked and hewed
  To fragments all that miserable band,
  Till not a soul of them was left alive.
  Then Xerxes saw disaster's depth, and shrieked,
  From where he sat on high, surveying all&mdash;
  A lofty eminence, beside the brine,
  Whence all his armament lay clear in view.
  His robe he rent, with loud and bitter wail,
  And to his land-force swiftly gave command
  And fled, with shame beside him! Now, lament

  Dropping before they drank, and some outworn,
  Pursued, and panting all their life away.
  The rest of us our way to Phocis won,
  And thence to Doris and the Melian gulf,
  Where with soft stream Spercheus laves the soil.
  Thence to the northward did Phthiotis' plain,
  And some Thessalian fortress, lend us aid,

  The army ventured on the frozen ford:
  Yet only those who crossed before the sun

  For soon the fervour of the glowing orb
  Did with its keen rays pierce the ice-bound stream,
  And men sank through and thrust each other down&mdash;

  Over the folk a Mede, Astyages,

  Third in succession, Cyrus, blest of Heaven,

  Fourth in the dynasty was Cyrus' son,
  And fifth was Mardus, scandal of his land
  And ancient lineage. Him Artaphrenes,
  Hardy of heart, within his palace slew,
  Aided by loyal plotters, set for this.

  Around his body, woefully unstitched,
  Mere tattered fragments of once royal robes!
  Go thou to him, speak soft and soothing words&mdash;
  Thee, and none other, will he bear to hear,

  From earth above, unto the nether gloom;
  Therefore, old men, take my farewell, and clasp,

  Clansmen of Cadmus, at the signal given
  By time and season must the ruler speak
  Who sets the course and steers the ship of State
  With hand upon the tiller, and with eye
  Watchful against the treachery of sleep.
  For if all go aright, <i>thank Heaven</i>, men say,
  But if adversely&mdash;which may God forefend!&mdash;
  One name on many lips, from street to street,
  Would bear the bruit and rumour of the time,
  <i>Down with Eteocles</i>!&mdash;a clamorous curse,
  A dirge of ruin. May averting Zeus
  Make good his title here, in Cadmus' hold!
  You it beseems now boys unripened yet
  To lusty manhood, men gone past the prime
  And increase of the full begetting seed,
  And those whom youth and manhood well combined
  Array for action&mdash;all to rise in aid
  Of city, shrines, and altars of all powers
  Who guard our land; that ne'er, to end of time,
  Be blotted out the sacred service due
  To our sweet mother-land and to her brood.
  For she it was who to their guest-right called
  Your waxing youth, was patient of the toil,
  And cherished you on the land's gracious lap,
  Alike to plant the hearth and bear the shield
  In loyal service, for an hour like this.
  Mark now! until to-day, luck rules our scale;
  For we, though long beleaguered, in the main
  Have with our sallies struck the foemen hard.
  But now the seer, the feeder of the birds,
  (Whose art unerring and prophetic skill
  Of ear and mind divines their utterance
  Without the lore of fire interpreted)
  Foretelleth, by the mastery of his art,
  That now an onset of Achaea's host
  Is by a council of the night designed
  To fall in double strength upon our walls.
  Up and away, then, to the battlements,
  The gates, the bulwarks!  don your panoplies,
  Array you at the breast-work, take your stand
  On floorings of the towers, and with good heart
  Stand firm for sudden sallies at the gates,
  Nor hold too heinous a respect for hordes
  Sent on you from afar: some god will guard!
  I too, for shrewd espial of their camp,
  Have sent forth scouts, and confidence is mine
  They will not fail nor tremble at their task,
  And, with their news, I fear no foeman's guile.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Eteocles, high king of Cadmus' folk,
  I stand here with news certified and sure
  From Argos' camp, things by myself descried.
  Seven warriors yonder, doughty chiefs of might,
  Into the crimsoned concave of a shield
  Have shed a bull's blood, and, with hands immersed
  Into the gore of sacrifice, have sworn
  By Ares, lord of fight, and by thy name,
  Blood-lapping Terror, <i>Let our oath be heard&mdash;
  Either to raze the walls, make void the hold
  Of Cadmus&mdash;strive his children as they may&mdash;
  Or, dying here, to make the foemen's land
  With blood impasted</i>. Then, as memory's gift
  Unto their parents at the far-off home,
  Chaplets they hung upon Adrastus' car,
  With eyes tear-dropping, but no word of moan.
  For their steeled spirit glowed with high resolve,
  As lions pant, with battle in their eyes.
  For them, no weak alarm delays the clear
  Issues of death or life! I parted thence
  Even as they cast the lots, how each should lead,
  Against which gate, his serried company.
  Rank then thy bravest, with what speed thou may'st,
  Hard by the gates, to dash on them, for now,
  Full-armed, the onward ranks of Argos come!
  The dust whirls up, and from their panting steeds
  White foamy flakes like snow bedew the plain.
  Thou therefore, chieftain! like a steersman skilled,
  Enshield the city's bulwarks, ere the blast
  Of war comes darting on them! hark, the roar
  Of the great landstorm with its waves of men!
  Take Fortune by the forelock! for the rest,
  By yonder dawn-light will I scan the field
  Clear and aright, and surety of my word
  Shall keep thee scatheless of the coming storm.

      the dust rises up to the sky,
  A signal, though speechless, of doom,
      a herald more clear than a cry!
  Hoof-trampled, the land of my love
      bears onward the din to mine ears.
  As a torrent descending a mountain,

      shall I bow me in terror and pray?
  O gods high-throned in bliss,
      we must crouch at the shrines in your home!
  Not here must we tarry and wail:
      shield clashes on shield as they come&mdash;

  And ye, O protecting gods,
      in pity your people behold!
  Yea, save us, the maidenly troop,
      from the doom and despair of the slave,
  For the crests of the foemen come onward,
      their rush is the rush of a wave
  Rolled on by the war-god's breath!
      almighty one, hear us and save
  From the grasp of the Argives' might!
      to the ramparts of Cadmus they crowd,
  And, clenched in the teeth of the steeds,
      the bits clink horror aloud!
  And seven high chieftains of war,
      with spear and with panoply bold,
  Are set, by the law of the lot,
      to storm the seven gates of our hold!
  Be near and befriend us, O Pallas,
      the Zeus-born maiden of might!
  O lord of the steed and the sea,

      O Hera, to thee is our call!
  Artemis, maiden beloved!
      the air is distraught with the spears,
  And whither doth destiny drive us,
      and where is the goal of our fears?
  The blast of the terrible stones
      on the ridge of our wall is not stayed,
  At the gates is the brazen clash
      of the bucklers&mdash;Apollo to aid!
  Thou too, O daughter of Zeus,
      who guidest the wavering fray
  To the holy decision of fate,

  List to the call of the maidens,

  Should fling yourselves, and scream and shriek your fears?
  Immodest, uncontrolled! Be this my lot&mdash;

  Where womankind has power, no man can house,
  Where womankind feeds panic, ruin rules

  Your flying feet, and rumour of your fears,
  Have spread a soulless panic on our walls,
  And they without do go from strength to strength,
  And we within make breach upon ourselves!
  Such fate it brings, to house with womankind.
  Therefore if any shall resist my rule&mdash;
  Or man, or woman, or some sexless thing&mdash;
  The vote of sentence shall decide their doom,
  And stones of execution, past escape,
  Shall finish all. Let not a woman's voice

  Well have I scanned the foe, and well can say
  Unto which chief, by lot, each gate is given.
  Tydeus already with his onset-cry
  Storms at the gate called Proetides; but him
  The seer Amphiaraus holds at halt,
  Nor wills that he should cross Ismenus' ford,
  Until the sacrifices promise fair.
  But Tydeus, mad with lust of blood and broil,
  Like to a cockatrice at noontide hour,
  Hisses out wrath and smites with scourge of tongue
  The prophet-son of Oecleus&mdash;<i>Wise thou art,
  Faint against war, and holding back from death</i>!
  With such revilings loud upon his lips
  He waves the triple plumes that o'er his helm
  Float overshadowing, as a courser's mane;
  And at his shield's rim, terror in their tone,
  Clang and reverberate the brazen bells.
  And this proud sign, wrought on his shield, he bears&mdash;
  The vault of heaven, inlaid with blazing stars;
  And, for the boss, the bright moon glows at full,
  The eye of night, the first and lordliest star.
  Thus with high-vaunted armour, madly bold,
  He clamours by the stream-bank, wild for war,
  As a steed panting grimly on his bit,
  Held in and chafing for the trumpet's bray!
  Whom wilt thou set against him? when the gates
  Of Proetus yield, who can his rush repel?

  The nightly sky displayed, ablaze with stars,
  Upon his shield, palters with double sense&mdash;
  One headstrong fool will find its truth anon!
  For, if night fall upon his eyes in death,
  Yon vaunting blazon will its own truth prove,
  And he is prophet of his folly's fall.
  Mine shall it be, to pit against his power
  The loyal son of Astacus, as guard
  To hold the gateways&mdash;a right valiant soul,
  Who has in heed the throne of Modesty
  And loathes the speech of Pride, and evermore
  Shrinks from the base, but knows no other fear.
  He springs by stock from those whom Ares spared,
  The men called Sown, a right son of the soil,
  And Melanippus styled. Now, what his arm
  To-day shall do, rests with the dice of war,
  And Ares shall ordain it; but his cause
  Hath the true badge of Right, to urge him on
  To guard, as son, his motherland from wrong.

  Soon shall we know how his device shall end&mdash;
  Whether the gold-wrought symbols on his shield,
  In their mad vaunting and bewildered pride,
  Shall guide him as a victor to his home!
  For had but Justice, maiden-child of Zeus,
  Stood by his act and thought, it might have been!
  Yet never, from the day he reached the light
  Out of the darkness of his mother's womb,
  Never in childhood, nor in youthful prime,
  Nor when his chin was gathering its beard,
  Hath Justice hailed or claimed him as her own.
  Therefore I deem not that she standeth now
  To aid him in this outrage on his home!
  Misnamed, in truth, were Justice, utterly,
  If to impiety she lent her hand.
  Sure in this faith, I will myself go forth
  And match me with him; who hath fairer claim?
  Ruler, against one fain to snatch the rule,
  Brother with brother matched, and foe with foe,
  Will I confront the issue. To the wall!

  Drinking the clotted stain, the gory dye&mdash;
    Who, who can purify?
  Who cleanse pollution, where the ancient bane
    Rises and reeks again?

  A twofold horror he wrought,
      in the frenzied despair of his breast&mdash;
  Debarred from the grace of the banquet,

  For why? he hated those who hated us,
  And, with all duties blamelessly performed
  Unto the sacred ritual of his sires,
  He met such end as gains our city's grace,&mdash;
  With auspices that do ennoble death.
  Such words I have in charge to speak of him:

  Be he cast out unburied, for the dogs
  To rend and tear: for he presumed to waste
  The land of the Cadmeans, had not Heaven&mdash;

  Opposed his onset, by his brother's spear,
  To whom, tho' dead, shall consecration come!

  Of foreign foemen, to beset our town.
  He therefore shall receive his recompense,
  Buried ignobly in the maw of kites&mdash;

      ARGUMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning, Ouranos and Gaia held sway over Heaven and Earth. And
      manifold children were born unto them, of whom were Cronos, and Okeanos,
      and the Titans, and the Giants. But Cronos cast down his father Ouranos,
      and ruled in his stead, until Zeus his son cast him down in his turn, and
      became King of Gods and men. Then were the Titans divided, for some had
      good will unto Cronos, and others unto Zeus; until Prometheus, son of the
      Titan lapetos, by wise counsel, gave the victory to Zeus. But Zeus held
      the race of mortal men in scorn, and was fain to destroy them from the
      face of the earth; yet Prometheus loved them, and gave secretly to them
      the gift of fire, and arts whereby they could prosper upon the earth. Then
      was Zeus sorely angered with Prometheus, and bound him upon a mountain,
      and afterward overwhelmed him in an earthquake, and devised other torments
      against him for many ages; yet could he not slay Prometheus, for he was a
      God.

  Know that, when first the gods  began  their strife,

  Some willing to fling Cronos from his throne,
  And set, forsooth, their Zeus on high as king,
  And other some in contrariety
  Striving to bar him from heaven's throne for aye&mdash;
  Thereon I sought to counsel for the best
  The Titan brood of Ouranos and Earth;
  Yet I prevailed not, for they held in scorn
  My glozing wiles, and, in their hardy pride,
  Deemed that sans effort they could grasp the sway.
  But, for my sake, my mother Themis oft,
  And Earth, one symbol of names manifold,
  Had held me warned, how in futurity
  It stood ordained that not by force or power,
  But by some wile, the victors must prevail.
  In such wise I interpreted; but they
  Deigned not to cast their heed thereon at all.
  Then, of things possible, I deemed it best,
  Joining my mother's wisdom to mine own,
  To range myself with Zeus, two wills in one.
  Thus, by device of mine, the murky depth
  Of Tartarus enfoldeth Cronos old
  And those who strove beside him. Such the aid

  Now, to your question&mdash;hear me clearly show

  Scarce was he seated on his father's throne,
  When he began his doles of privilege
  Among the lesser gods, allotting power
  In trim division; while of mortal men
  Nothing he recked, nor of their misery
  Nay, even willed to blast their race entire
  To nothingness, and breed another brood;
  And none but I was found to cross his will.
  I dared it, I alone; I rescued men
  From crushing ruin and th' abyss of hell&mdash;
  Therefore am I constrained in chastisement
  Grievous to bear and piteous to behold,&mdash;

  Myself was held unworthy of the same&mdash;

  For the woe and the wreck and the doom,
     Prometheus I utter my sighs;
  O'er my cheek flows the fountain of tears
     from tender, compassionate eyes.
  For stern and abhorred is the sway
     of Zeus on his self-sought throne,
  And ruthless the spear of his scorn,
     to the gods of the days that are done.
  And over the limitless earth
     goes up a disconsolate cry:
  <i>Ye were all so fair, and have fallen;
     so great and your might has gone by</i>!
  So wails with a mighty lament
     the voice of the mortals, who dwell
  In the Eastland, the home of the holy,
     for thee and the fate that befel;
  And they of the Colchian land, the
     maidens whose arm is for war;
  And the Scythian bowmen, who roam
     by the lake of Maeotis afar;
  And the blossom of battling hordes,
     that flowers upon Caucasus' height,
  With clashing of lances that pierce,
     and with clamour of swords that smite.
  Strange is thy sorrow! one only I know
     who has suffered thy pain&mdash;
  Atlas the Titan, the god,
     in a ruthless, invincible chain!
  He beareth for ever and ever
     the burden and poise of the sky,
  The vault of the rolling heaven,
     and earth re-echoes his cry.
  The depths of the sea are troubled;
     they mourn from their caverns profound,
  And the darkest and innermost hell
     moans deep with a sorrowful sound;
  And the rivers of waters, that flow
     from the fountains that spring without stain,
  Are as one in the great lamentation,
     and moan for thy piteous pain.

  Deem not that I in pride or wilful scorn

  That rends my heart, when I behold myself
  Abased to wretchedness. To these new gods
  I and none other gave their lots of power
  In full attainment; no more words hereof
  I speak&mdash;the tale ye know. But listen now
  Unto the rede of mortals and their woes,
  And how their childish and unreasoning state
  Was changed by me to consciousness and thought.
  Yet not in blame of mortals will I speak,
  But as in proof of service wrought to them.
  For, in the outset, eyes they had and saw not;
  And ears they had but heard not; age on age,
  Like unsubstantial shapes in vision seen,
  They groped at random in the world of sense,
  Nor knew to link their building, brick with brick,
  Nor how to turn its aspect to the sun,
  Nor how to join the beams by carpentry,
  In hollowed caves they dwelt, as emmets dwell,
  Weak feathers for each blast, in sunless caves.
  Nor had they certain forecast of the cold,
  Nor of the advent of the flowery spring,
  Nor of the fruitful summer. All they wrought,
  Unreasoning they wrought, till I made clear
  The laws of rising stars, and inference dim,
  More hard to learn, of what their setting showed.
  I taught to them withal that art of arts,
  The lore of number, and the written word
  That giveth sense to sound, the tool wherewith
  The gift of memory was wrought in all,
  And so came art and song. I too was first
  To harness 'neath the yoke strong animals,
  Obedient made to collar and to weight,
  That they might bear whate'er of heaviest toil
  Mortals endured before. For chariots too
  I trained, and docile service of the rein,
  Steeds, the delight of wealth and pomp and pride.
  I too, none other, for seafarers wrought
  Their ocean-roaming canvas-wingèd cars.
  Such arts of craft did I, unhappy I,
  Contrive for mortals: now, no feint I have
  Whereby I may elude my present woe.

  More wilt thou wonder when the rest thou hearest&mdash;
  What arts for them, what methods I devised.
  Foremost was this: if any man fell sick,
  No aiding art he knew, no saving food,
  No curing oil nor draught, but all in lack
  Of remedies they dwindled, till I taught
  The medicinal blending of soft drugs,
  Whereby they ward each sickness from their side.
  I ranged for them the methods manifold
  Of the diviner's art; I first discerned
  Which of night's visions hold a truth for day,
  I read for them the lore of mystic sounds,
  Inscrutable before; the omens seen
  Which bless or ban a journey, and the flight
  Of crook-clawed birds, did I make clear to man&mdash;
  And how they soar upon the right, for weal,
  How, on the left, for evil; how they dwell,
  Each in its kind, and what their loves and hates,
  And which can flock and roost in harmony.
  From me, men learned what deep significance
  Lay in the smoothness of the entrails set
  For sacrifice, and which, of various hues,
  Showed them a gift accepted of the gods;
  They learned what streaked and varied comeliness
  Of gall and liver told; I led them, too,
  (By passing thro' the flame the thigh-bones, wrapt
  In rolls of fat, and th' undivided chine),
  Unto the mystic and perplexing lore
  Of omens; and I cleared unto their eyes
  The forecasts, dim and indistinct before,
  Shown in the flickering aspect of a flame.
  Of these, enough is said. The other boons,
  Stored in the womb of earth, in aid of men&mdash;
  Copper and iron, silver, gold withal&mdash;
  Who dares affirm he found them ere I found?
  None&mdash;well I know&mdash;save who would babble lies!

  Well were it, Io, thus to do their will&mdash;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I know not how I should mistrust your prayer;
  Therefore the whole that ye desire of me
  Ye now shall learn in one straightforward tale.
  Yet, as it leaves my lips, I blush with shame
  To tell that tempest of the spite of Heaven,
  And all the wreck and ruin of my form,
  And whence they swooped upon me, woe is me!
  Long, long in visions of the night there came
  Voices and forms into my maiden bower,
  Alluring me with smoothly glozing words&mdash;
  <i>O maiden highly favoured of high Heaven,
  Why cherish thy virginity so long?
  Thine is it to win wedlock's noblest crown!
  Know that Zeus' heart thro' thee is all aflame,
  Pierced with desire as with a dart, and longs
  To join in utmost rite of love with thee.
  Therefore, O maiden, shun not with disdain</i>
  <i>Th' embrace of Zeits, but hie thee forth straightway
  To the lush growth of Lerna's meadow-land,
  Where are the flocks and steadings of thy home,
  And let Zeus' eye be eased of its desire</i>.
  Night after night, haunted by dreams like these,
  Heartsick, I ventured at the last to tell
  Unto my sire these visions of the dark.
  Then sent he many a wight, on sacred quest,
  To Delphi and to far Dodona's shrine,
  Being fall fain to learn what deed or word
  Would win him favour from the powers of heaven.
  But they came back repeating oracles
  Mystic, ambiguous, inscrutable,
  Till, at the last, an utterance direct,
  Obscure no more, was brought to Inachus&mdash;
  A peremptory charge to fling me forth
  Beyond my home and fatherland, a thing
  Sent loose in banishment o'er all the world;
  And&mdash;should he falter&mdash;Zeus should launch on him
  A fire-eyed bolt, to shatter and consume
  Himself and all his race to nothingness.
  Bowing before such utterance from the shrine
  Of Loxias, he drave me from our halls,
  Barring the gates against me: loth he was
  To do, as I to suffer, this despite:
  But the strong curb of Zeus had overborne
  His will to me-ward.  As I parted thence,
  In form and mind I grew dishumanized,
  And horned as now ye see me, poison-stung
  By the envenomed bitings of the brize,
  I leapt and flung in frenzy, rushed away
  To the bright waters of Cerchneia's stream
  And Lerna's beach: but ever at my side,
  A herdsman by his heifer, Argus moved,
  Earth-born, malevolent of mood, and peered,
  With myriad eyes, where'er my feet would roam.
  But on him in a moment, unforeseen,
  Came Fate, and sundered him from life; but I,
  Still maddened by the gadfly's sting, the scourge
  Of God's infliction, roam the weary world.
  How I have fared, thou hearest: be there aught
  Of what remains to bear, that thou canst tell,
  Speak on! but let not thy compassion warm
  Thy words to cheering falsehood.  Worst of woes
  Are words that break their promise to our hope!

  Who dwell in wattled homes, not built on earth
  But borne along on wains of sturdy wheel&mdash;
  Equipped, themselves, with bows of mighty reach.

  Right to the very Caucasus, the peak
  That overtops the world, and from its brows
  The river pants in spray its wrathful stream.
  Thence, o'er the pinnacles that court the stars,
  Onward and southward thou must take thy way,
  And reach the warlike horde of Amazons,
  Maidens through hate of man; and gladly they
  Will guide thy maiden feet.  That host, in days
  That are not yet, shall fix their home and dwell
  At Themiscyra, on Thermodon's bank,
  Nigh whereunto the grim projecting fang
  Of Salmydessus' cape affronts the main,
  The seaman's curse, to ships a stepmother!
  Then at the jutting land, Cimmerian styled,
  That screens the narrowing portal of the mere,
  Thou shalt arrive; pass o'er it, brave at heart,
  And ferry thee across Macotis' ford.
  So shall there be great rumour evermore,
  In ears of mortals, of thy passage strange;
  And Bosporos shall be that channel's name,
  Because the ox-horned thing did pass thereby.
  So, from the wilds of Europe wander'd o'er,
  To Asia's continent thou com'st at last.

  And tyrant of the gods, as tyrannous

  When thou hast overpast the ferry's flow
  That sunders continent from continent,
  Straight to the eastward and the flaming face
  Of dawn, and highways trodden by the sun,
  Pass, till thou come unto the windy land
  Of daughters born to Boreas: beware
  Lest the strong spirit of the stormy blast
  Snatch thee aloft, and sweep thee to the void,
  On wings of raving wintry hurricane!
  Wend by the noisy tumult of the wave,
  Until thou reach the Gorgon-haunted plains
  Beside Cisthene.  In that solitude
  Dwell Phorcys' daughters, beldames worn with time,
  Three, each swan-shapen, single-toothed, and all
  Peering thro' shared endowment of one eye;

  Never falls radiance of the midnight moon.
  But, hard by these, their sisters, clad with wings,

  Beware the Gryphon pack, the hounds of Zeus,
  As keen of fang as silent of their tongues!
  Beware the one-eyed Arimaspian band
  That tramp on horse-hoofs, dwelling by the ford
  Of Pluto and the stream that flows with gold:
  Keep thou aloof from these. To the world's end
  Thou comest at the last, the dark-faced tribe
  That dwell beside the sources of the sun,
  Where springs the river, Aethiopian named.
  Make thou thy way along his bank, until
  Thou come unto the mighty downward slope
  Where from the overland of Bybline hills
  Nile pours his hallowed earth-refreshing wave.
  He by his course shall guide thee to the realm
  Named from himself, three-angled, water-girt;
  There, Io, at the last, hath Fate ordained,
  For thee and for thy race, the charge to found,
  Far from thy native shore, a new abode.

  There lieth, at the verge of land and sea,
  Where Nilus issues thro' the silted sand,
  A town, Canopus called: and there at length
  Shall Zeus renew the reason in thy brain
  With the mere touch and contact of his hand
  Fraught now with fear no more: and thou shalt bear
  A child, dark Epaphus&mdash;his very name
  Memorial of Zeus' touch that gave him life.
  And his shall be the foison and the fruit
  Of all the land enriched by spreading Nile.
  Thence the fifth generation of his seed
  Back unto Argos, yet unwillingly,
  Shall flee for refuge&mdash;fifty maidens they,
  Loathing a wedlock with their next in blood,
  More kin than kind, from their sire's brother sprung.
  And on their track, astir with wild desire,
  Like falcons fierce closing on doves that flee,
  Shall speed the suitors, craving to achieve
  A prey forbidden, a reluctant bride.
  Yet power divine shall foil them, and forbid
  Possession of the maids, whom Argive land
  Shall hold protected, when unsleeping hate,
  Horror, and watchful ambush of the night,
  Have laid the suitors dead, by female hands.
  For every maid shall smite a man to death,
  Dyeing a dagger's edges in his throat&mdash;
  Such bed of love befall mine enemies!
  Yet in one bride shall yearning conquer hate,
  Bidding her spare the bridegroom at her side,
  Blunting the keen edge of her set resolve.
  Thus of two scorns the former shall she choose,
  The name of coward, not of murderess.
  In Argos shall she bear, in after time,
  A royal offspring.  Long it were to tell
  In clear succession all that thence shall be.
  Take this for sooth&mdash;in lineage from her
  A hero shall arise, an archer great,
  And he shall be my saviour from these woes.
  Such knowledge of the future Themis gave,
  The ancient Titaness, to me her son.
  But how, and by what skill, 'twere long to say,

  First shall the Sire, with thunder and the flame

  And in the shattered mass o'erwhelm thy form,
  Immured and morticed in a clasping rock.
  Thence, after age on age of durance done,
  Back to the daylight shall thou come, and there
  The eagle-hound of Zeus, red-ravening, fell
  With greed, shall tatter piecemeal all thy flesh
  To shreds and ragged vestiges of form&mdash;
  Yea, an unbidden guest, a day-long bane,
  That feeds, and feeds&mdash;yea, he shall gorge his fill
  On blackened fragments, from thy vitals gnawed.
  Look for no respite from that agony

  Ready to bear for thee the brunt of doom,
  Choosing to pass into the lampless world
  Of Hades and the murky depths of hell.
  Hereat, advise thee! 'tis no feigned threat
  Whereof I warn thee, but an o'er-true tale.
  The lips of Zeus know nought of lying speech,

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
